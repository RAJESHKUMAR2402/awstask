This is the Architecture that is designed is for high availability and scalability with two servers per availability zone and two availability zone with maximum of 4 ec2 instances based on traffic which is auto scaled automatically with Auto Scaling Group and making a smooth traffic flow with Application Load Balancer,Load balancer is in public subnet and sends to ec2 in private subnets,NAT Gateway is used in public subnet for Ec2 to connect with outside the AWS cloud,Aurora DB used for Database with their read replicas for safety and also elasticache used here for accessing the frequently used data to be accessed way  more faster, for the main safety of the application the request that are coming in form internet gateway are protected by Web Access Firewall,like that security groups for Ec2's inbounds, outbounds and network Access Control List for Subnets,A main part of the Architecture is Virtual Private Cloud which acts as a boundary that separate these cloud resources from other resources all these resources are monitored by cloud watch service for services usage data details and alerts
