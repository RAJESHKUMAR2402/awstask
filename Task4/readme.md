The importance of cost monitoring to beginners.

Beginners initially start to learn how to deploy all the resources in aws .but they forget to stop or destroy those ,monitoring the allocated resources are important because most the regularly used resources are repeated ,regular monitoring will definetely make sure bills are only by used resource with user knowledge, where lots money can be saved through this method.


What are the factors that lead to the sudden AWS bill increases?

Using the resources and forgetting to  delete it or stopping it will lead to bill increase or large transferin storages will also lead to bills in large number .using resources without pricing knowledge will also lead to bill and proper destroy will definetely reduce bills . Not setting up alerts and limits will increase bills without knowledge
